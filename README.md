In this scenario, I analyzed Canadian immigration data focusing on the skilled worker stream and Canadian international students data on study permit holders. I visualized the Express Entry system's invitations and scores since 2015 and the study permit holders in Canada from 2000 to 2019. The raw data is available on the IRCC website. 

# Show Express Entry targeted on what programs and invited how many applicants since 2015.

In 2020 the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) started being solely targeted. 

Under COVID-19, Express Entry's effect started solely and regularly targeted CEC with a relatively low cutoff score. Applicants have Canadian Post Secondary credential and are living in Canada. International students in Canada will have an excellent opportunity to convert into Canadian permenant residence.

CEC's cutoff score is lower than No Program Specified's. Applicants with Canadian study experience now have more chances to be invited than before.

Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec were the three provinces with most international students studying for Post Secondary in the recent ten years. Ontario is the dominant destination for international students studying in Post Secondary. The number of Ontario in 2019 even exceeded the number of British Columbia, and Quebec combined.

Find out that India is ranked the first origin country for Canadian international students, China is the second.     

Chinese international students accounted for 1/5 of the total study permit holders in Canada.
